# Intility Bifrost Theme 
This is a color theme for Visual Studio Code inspired by the [Intility Bifrost Design System](https://bifrost.intility.com/). 

___
## Installation
Open VS Code and search for `Intility Bifrost` in the Extensions pane, and then intall and activate the color theme. 

The theme should work with any font/typeface, but I recommend installing and using [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). Once the font is installed, just open `Settings` in VS Code, search for `Font` and add `JetBrains Mono` to the front of the list.

## Feedback
There are a lot of bits and pieces that can and have been colored in VS Code by this theme, and I anticipate some bugs and/or less-than-optimal color usage. If you are using the theme and want to either report a bug/potential color issue and/or give other feedback on the theme, please [get in touch](msteams://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=august.gaukstad@intility.no) with me *(the link opens a chat with me in Microsoft Teams)*.

**Happy coding! :)**
